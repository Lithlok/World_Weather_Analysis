# World_Weather_Analysis

This repository containes Jupyter Notebook files, CSV dataframes, and figures of data collected.

The purpose of the data collcted is to show the usage of API keys through collecting weather and city information and using those outcomes to let a user choose ideal temperatures, and then further to let the user decide which cities to visit. 

(All files, code, and figures are randomly generated using randomly assigned latitude and longitude, then finding the closet city to those coordinates.)
